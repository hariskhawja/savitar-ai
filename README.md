# Cotax.AI Assignment Review

## Project Description
This project is a frontend web application built using the **Next.js** framework and **TypeScript** for programming. It leverages **Next.js** to set up a route to interact with the **OpenAI GPT-4o** model **API**, allowing users to engage with advanced language processing capabilities. To streamline communication between the frontend and OpenAI, the **Vercel AI SDK** is used as middleware, providing a seamless integration of the language model into the application. The design of the application draws inspiration from the cotax.ai website, aiming for a clean, user-friendly interface that enhances the overall experience.

## Functionalities Implemented
- **Real-time conversations** enabled between users and OpenAI's GPT-4o using the **Vercel AI SDK** `useChat` hook, ensuring seamless interactions.
- **Messages are formatted in markdown**, allowing advanced text formatting and the ability to display graphs, HTML, and tables in responses.
- **File attachments** support up to 5 files per input, including images, text, and PDF files, enabling AI to analyze visual content or scan important documents.
- **Quick reply feature** powered by the **Fisher-Yates algorithm** to randomly generate relevant questions, offering users a dynamic, guided interaction with the AI.
- **UI/UX prioritized**, using **TailwindCSS** alongside UI libraries like **ShadCN** and **Lucide-React** to create an attractive, responsive design.
- **Multimedia outputs** include markdown-formatted text, graphs from scripts, and tables, enriching the user experience with diverse content types.

## Next Steps
- **Utilize OpenAI's image generation models**, such as **DALLÂ·E**, or convert Python scripts into real-time graphs using libraries like **PyDiode** (or a similar solution) to enhance multi-modal outputs and improve the overall user experience.
- **Integrate TanStack Query** along with **Google OAuth** to track user chat history, enabling the AI to offer a more personalized and tailored interaction for each user.
